# FileManager



Available commands:
list - displays contents in a directory in the form of a list
info - displays the contents of a file
mkdir - creates a new directory
rename - allows to change the name of a file
copy - creates a copy of a chosen file
move - changes the location of a file to a chosen directory
delete - deletes a chosen file

The type of user whom would come across the listed commands would be possibly looking to manipulate files and
directories. Using commands such as 'copy' and 'move' a user can create a copy and/or move it into a different
directory. Utilizing the 'delete' command the user can remove a file all together. To check the contents
of a directory utilizing the 'list' command followed by the file path location would display them in the shell.
The 'mkdir' command creates a new directory followed by a prompt asking the user to enter a directory name. Once
the user is finished in the manager shell, the 'quit' command would close the shell down.
